# E-commerce site template

## Welcome to my first project!

What you're looking at is my very first self imposed project. I started working on this template about 2.5 months into the fullstack webdev Udemy course thaty I'm taking (LAMP stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python).

Much of my inspiration was taken from takealot.com, which is probably the largest South African e-commerce site. I literally crawled through the HTML and style sections of the site to understand a replicate what takealot had acheived. I'm glad to report that I managed to replicate the general layout of a store page (as you'll see in the live demo). 

I plan with this template is to iterating on this template as time goes on and I gain experience. My next step for this project is to turn it into a better single page application using JS and the React framework and MySQL or PostgreSQL. This is a very rough plan right now since I know only a little bit of JS and practically nothing about the backend and databases.

Since you've taken the time to come and see this site maybe consider bookmarking this page and occasionally checking the changes to the site throught the live demo.

Thank You for Your Time!
